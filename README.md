# AI Question Answering Assistant using Gemini API

## Overview
This project is a simple AI-powered Question Answering Assistant built using
Google's Gemini API. It allows users to ask questions in natural language and
receive intelligent AI-generated responses.

## Problem Statement
Finding accurate and quick answers using traditional systems can be time-consuming.
This project demonstrates how Generative AI can help users get instant,
context-aware answers.

## Solution
The application takes user input from the terminal and sends it to the Gemini API.
Gemini processes the query and returns a relevant AI-generated response.

## Technology Stack
- Python
- Google Gemini API
- Generative AI

## How Gemini API is Used
Gemini API is used as the core intelligence engine. The application sends user
questions to the `generate_content()` method of Gemini, which generates
natural language responses.

## How to Run the Project
1. Install Python (3.8+ recommended)
2. Install dependencies:
3. Add your Gemini API key in `app.py`
4. Run the application:
   ## Sample Output
User: What is Artificial Intelligence?  
AI: Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines.

## Future Scope
- Web-based interface
- Multi-language support
- Voice-based interaction
- File-based question answering
